1.EduConsultPro Student Flow :
Purpose: This flow seems designed to handle student registrations based on selected courses.
Process:
Starts with gathering student information and creating a student record.
Presents a course selection screen, leading to a decision point where different paths are taken based on the course selected (e.g., MPC, BIPC, ELECTRONICS, ELECTRICAL, COMPUTERS).
Each course branch retrieves specific records and creates registration records.
After registration, the flow sends an email to the student and displays a success screen.

2.EduConsultPro Existing Student Flow:
Purpose: This flow handles cases for existing students, helping them book appointments or create cases.
Process:
It begins by retrieving student information and relevant records.
At a decision point, it determines whether the student needs an "Appointment" or a "Case."
For appointments, it leads to a booking screen, finds available consultants, and finalizes the appointment with a confirmation.
For cases, it creates a new case for the student and ends the flow.

3.EduConsultPro Main Flow :
Purpose: This main flow decides if the student is new or existing and directs them to the appropriate subflow.
Process:
Starts with a welcome screen and a confirmation to check if the student is existing or new.
Based on the decision:
Existing Student: It calls the "Existing Student Flow," presumably the second flow.
New Student: It calls the "New Student Flow," likely the first flow.
Ends after the appropriate subflow completes.

4. EduConsultPro Approval Flow :
Purpose: This approval flow automates the approval process for student-related records, triggered by specific record events.
Process:Record-Triggered Flow (Start): The flow initiates immediately upon a record change that meets the trigger conditions. 
This means any record that matches specific criteria will start the approval process without manual intervention.
Approval SubFlow: After triggering, the flow calls an Approval SubFlow. 
This subflow handles specific actions needed for the approval process, such as routing approval requests to appropriate team members or updating the recordâ€™s status based on the decision.
End: The flow concludes after the approval process completes, marking the record's status or performing other final actions as needed.
